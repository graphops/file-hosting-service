# Contracts

Generated from https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts at commit a667f7aba10d558af6485d34cf857204321e343c.

Copy and pasted `addresses.json` and abis is from `/build/abis`

> In theory, contract ABIs can be imported with a path using Etherscan or npmjs, with "online" / "abigen_online" feature
> But... could not get the crate to find the file online, rip. So just importing the hardcoded files
