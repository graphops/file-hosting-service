# On-chain Interactions

## Network specification

Note: Contract artifacts are generated from https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts at commit a667f7aba10d558af6485d34cf857204321e343c. (location: `/build/abis`). Contract address book (`addresses.jon`) is copy and pasted from the same commit.

> In theory, contract ABIs can be imported with a path using Etherscan or npmjs, with "online" / "abigen_online" feature. But having issues to connect with this method. The current manual solution is only temporary.

Currently we only utilizes `L2Staking` contract for allocations.
